# Conditional Random Field (CRF) for Root Cause Analysis during Process Mining Industry

This work was carried out during the GDR MaDICS inaugural launch. It held its first Business Study Week in Data Sciences of the GDR CNRS MaDICS (SEEDS@MaDICS). This meeting aims to create exchanges between industrial circles and the academic world through a week of work on problems posed by industrialists and requiring innovative computer science and/or mathematical approaches. Inspired by the SEME (Mathematics Study Week â€“ Business) model of AMIES.

SEEDS@MaDICS took place at the University of Technology of Troyes from March 27 to March 31, 2023.


Project realized using Python

* Logistic_regression -> LR on the first events on we print the coefficients to analyze the global trend
* CRF-> the model of the CRF with the features of interest
* BiLSTM_CRF-> modeling using conditional chain of probabilities and analyzing the weight contributon of the Neural Network
* Transition_exploration-> to analyze transition probability and frequency of appration 
* time_an -> some utils to analyze time in the dataset, the class related to the logistic is in this file
* Pre_process-> some pre_process and utils are in this folder
* Markov_chain -> some codes to estimate te transition matrix
